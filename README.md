# ESP8266-Environmental-Monitor
ESP8266 with DHT22/11 for Environmental Monitoring with data logging to remote web server (PHP) and database (MySQL)

This is a repository sharing code used on a series of ESP8266 microcontrollers with DHT22/11 temperature and humidity sensors, analog sensors and/or distance sensors which then connect over WiFi to your PHP server and inserts the data into your MySQL server.

Some more detail on how I used this for fun projects around the house here:
